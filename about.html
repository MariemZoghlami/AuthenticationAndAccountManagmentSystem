<h1> About us </h1>
<p>
    This isn’t a company. Not yet. It’s a seed. An idea. A small spark built from curiosity, long nights, and the belief that the best things start small — and honest.
</p>

<p>
    There are no CEOs here. No funding. No buzzwords. Just someone who looked at a blank screen and thought: “Let’s build something that means something.”
</p>

<p>
    You're looking at a self-made lab. A playground of code, creativity, and possibility. It’s not just about software — it’s about storytelling through technology. A project that doesn't just say *"I can code."* It says *"I care about what I create."*
</p>

<p>
    This space was made to show you something real: how I learn, how I build, how I grow. Not perfect. Not finished. But full of intention. Ready for any mission — in any field.
</p>

<p>
        If you're a company looking for someone with checkboxes, you’ll find a lot of them out there. But if you're looking for someone who treats every project like a craft — someone who thinks differently — you just found them.
</p>

<p>
<em>This isn’t “About Us.” This is “Just Getting Started.”</em>
